# Shopping App - Java-Based Online Shopping Application

This app offers users a curated selection of items from three popular stores—Amazon, Shein, and Myntra—within their chosen category. This saves the user from the effort of browsing across different websites and choosing the most suitable option. Instead, this portal that we have created allows the user to view various options coming from the three major online shopping websites and proceed with their payment

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The main programming language used for backend logic .
  
- **Java Swing**: The GUI toolkit used for creating the graphical user interface.
  
- **MySQL** : To integrate a database for product and user data storage.

## Key Features

- **User Registration and Login**: New users can register, and existing users can log in to access the shopping portal.

- **Product Browsing**: Users can browse products by category (e.g., Men, Women) and apply filters to find the desired items.

- **Multi-Store Integration**: Products from Amazon, Shein, and Myntra are displayed in one place, saving users time and effort.

## Concepts Used

This project utilizes several core Java concepts and technologies:

1. **Graphical User Interface (GUI)**: Built using Java Swing, the app provides an interactive and user-friendly interface.
   
3. **Exception Handling**: Ensures the application handles runtime errors gracefully without crashing.
   
5. **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC)**: Connects to a MySQL database to store and retrieve product and user information.
   
7. **Inheritance**: Used to extend classes like `JFrame` and `JPanel` to create reusable components.
   
9. **Collection Frameworks**: Utilizes `Vector` and `HashMap` for efficient data storage and retrieval.
    
11. **Method Overriding**: Custom implementations of methods like `actionPerformed` to handle button clicks.
    
13. **Encapsulation**: Ensures data security by restricting access to class members and providing controlled access through methods.
